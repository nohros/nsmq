# Nohros Message Queue

Nohros Message Queue or NSMQ is a message queue implementation that uses ZeroMQ and LDB. It is essentially a messaging protocol that allows applications running on separate servers/processes to communicate in a failsafe manner. A queue is a temporary storage location from which messages can be sent and received reliably, as and when conditions permit. This enables communication across networks and between computers which may not always be connected.
